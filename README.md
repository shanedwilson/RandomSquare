### RandomSquares
This was an exercise for NSS C#/.Net backend

Using the Random class, generate a list of 20 random numbers that are in the range of 1-50.

2. With the resulting List, populate a new List that contains each number squared. For example, if the original list is `2, 5, 3, 15`, the final list will be `4, 25, 9, 225`.

3. Then remove any number that is odd from the list of squared numbers.
